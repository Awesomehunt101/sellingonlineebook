      <p>Dear Online Marketer,      </p>
      <p>Your search  for the perfect online strategy is <span class="underline">over</span>. Don’t waste another minute looking for  solutions to lackluster customer response and failed sales campaigns.</p>
      
<p><img src="images/h2.png" width="660" height="55" /></p>

      <p class="bold">And rest assured:  there's plenty of money to be made.</p>
      
      
      <p>It really comes down to the basic principles that apply to selling in any context. Many people tend to think that Internet selling has to be easy. If you're in that group, it's really not your fault. There are hundreds, really thousands of Internet marketers who are selling you fancy-looking packages with lots of bells and whistles, telling you that all you need to do is buy their offer, and money will start flowing into your PayPal account faster than you can count it.</p>
      <p>Yes, that sounds really good, and perhaps deep down you wonder whether it's really that easy. I'm here to tell you that, while the Internet has made passive, recurring income much easier to obtain, your suspicions really are true. </p>
      
      <p><img src="images/h3.png" width="660" height="55" /></p>
      <p><span class="bold">&quot;But I  already have a job,&quot; you say. </span>&quot;The reason I'm studying about Internet  marketing is so that I don’t have to work so hard for the rest of my  life.&quot; Yes, that's exactly the point! And I totally agree with you. That’s  what attracts us all to Internet marketing. My point is that online selling is more  like old-fashioned, off-line selling than most of us recognize. There are  universal, time-tested rules to follow while you're laying the groundwork for  long-term success online.</p>

      <p>But the road to get to that point in your business is not by purchasing some "do it all for you" package. Nor do you get there by posting online a product that you'd be embarrassed to show your family or friends, hoping to make a quick buck and move onto the next thing.</p>
      
      <p><span class="bold">"So exactly what do I need to do to become a successful online business owner?" </span>you ask.</p>
